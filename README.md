Linear Regression Line


-The goal of this program is to compute the values of the linear equation y = mx + b while using matrix operations. This program will read in a text file of points stored in the form of a 2 x N matrix and calculate the regression line for those points using built in matrix operations. 

-Must run this program using a points file; there is one in this repository I have provided as an example. 

Make file is included for all dependencies.

example run: 

./ols points100.txt
